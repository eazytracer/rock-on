# Feature Specification: Rock On! - Band Management Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-use-this-prd`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Use this prd as a starting point to create our project specification: '/workspaces/rock-on/.claude/artifacts/band_management_prd.md'"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Band members need a centralized platform to coordinate rehearsals, manage their song repertoire, and prepare for performances. Musicians struggle with scheduling practices, tracking which songs are ready for performance, organizing setlists, and ensuring all band members are on the same page about upcoming shows and rehearsal priorities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a band has 20 songs in their catalog, **When** a member searches for songs in a specific key, **Then** the system displays only songs matching that key with readiness indicators
2. **Given** a practice session is scheduled, **When** the band leader selects songs for rehearsal, **Then** all band members receive notifications with the song list and session details
3. **Given** a show is upcoming, **When** the band creates a setlist, **Then** the system shows readiness warnings for songs that haven't been practiced recently
4. **Given** band members are rating song confidence levels, **When** all members submit their ratings, **Then** the overall song readiness is calculated and displayed
5. **Given** a practice session is in progress, **When** members take notes on specific songs, **Then** notes are saved and associated with both the session and individual songs

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle conflicting availability when scheduling practice sessions?
  Right now we don't need to worry about user availability, just sending calendar invites
- What occurs when a band wants to add a last-minute song to a setlist that hasn't been practiced?
  The band can always add a song whenever they want, just mark with a 'warning' indicator that it hasn't been practiced.
- How does the system manage bands with guest musicians or temporary members?
  Allow assignments of roles to songs to point to users as a string that doesn't exist.
