## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T006) blocks everything else
- Models (T007-T013) block Services (T017-T021)
- Services (T017-T021) block UI Components (T022-T030)
- Components (T022-T030) block Pages (T031-T036)
- Contract tests (T014-T016) must pass before service implementation
- Integration tests (T041-T046) require completed UI workflows

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- All model creation tasks (T007-T012) can run simultaneously
- All contract test tasks (T014-T016) can run simultaneously
- All service implementation tasks (T017-T020) can run simultaneously
- All component creation tasks (T022-T030) can run simultaneously
- All hook implementation tasks (T037-T040) can run simultaneously
- All integration test tasks (T041-T046) can run simultaneously

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Launch Models Creation Together:
```bash
# Run these tasks in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
Task: "Create Band model with Dexie schema in src/models/Band.ts"
Task: "Create Member model with Dexie schema in src/models/Member.ts"
Task: "Create Song model with Dexie schema in src/models/Song.ts"
Task: "Create PracticeSession model with Dexie schema in src/models/PracticeSession.ts"
Task: "Create Setlist model with Dexie schema in src/models/Setlist.ts"
```

### Launch Contract Tests Together:
```bash
# Run these tasks in parallel (independent test files)
Task: "Contract test for Songs API in tests/contract/songs-api.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for Practice Sessions API in tests/contract/practice-sessions-api.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for Setlists API in tests/contract/setlists-api.test.ts"
```

### Launch Integration Tests Together:
```bash
# Run these tasks in parallel (different workflow test files)
Task: "Integration test: Add songs to catalog workflow in tests/integration/song-management.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test: Schedule practice session workflow in tests/integration/practice-scheduling.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test: Conduct practice session workflow in tests/integration/practice-execution.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test: Create performance setlist workflow in tests/integration/setlist-creation.test.ts"
```

## Notes

### TDD Requirements
- Contract tests (T014-T016) MUST be written and failing before implementing services (T017-T021)
- Integration tests (T041-T046) MUST be written before implementing the full UI workflows
- All tests should follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle

### Mobile-First Implementation
- All components must work on 320px width minimum
- Touch targets must be minimum 44px for iOS compliance
- Use mobile-first TailwindCSS classes (base mobile, then sm:, md:, lg:)
- Test on actual mobile devices for gesture interactions

### Performance Requirements
- Initial bundle size under 500KB
- Page load time under 200ms on mobile networks
- Practice session timer must run accurately for 3+ hours
- Song search must return results instantly (<100ms)

### Constitutional Compliance
- Code Quality First: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier
- User Experience Consistency: TailwindCSS design system, mobile patterns
- Rapid Prototyping: MVP features only, proven libraries
- Test-Driven Development: Tests before implementation, 80%+ coverage
- Ease of Implementation: Simple architecture, minimal dependencies
