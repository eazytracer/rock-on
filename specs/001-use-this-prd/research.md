# Research Findings: Rock On! Mobile-First Platform

## Client-Side Database Solution

### Decision: Dexie.js
A TypeScript-friendly IndexedDB wrapper that provides excellent developer experience and performance for client-side data storage.

### Rationale
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified API reduces IndexedDB complexity by ~80%
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration with full type definitions
- **React Integration**: Built-in hooks via `dexie-react-hooks` for reactive queries
- **Performance**: 29KB bundle size, built-in transaction batching, mobile-optimized
- **Offline Capability**: Full offline functionality with no external service dependencies
- **Production Ready**: Used by 100,000+ websites with stable API

### Alternatives Considered
- **Raw IndexedDB**: Rejected due to complex API and poor developer experience
- **SQLite WASM**: Rejected due to large bundle size (939KB) and mobile performance impact
- **LocalStorage**: Rejected due to 5-10MB limit and lack of structured query capabilities
- **RxDB/PouchDB**: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity for this use case

## Mobile-First React Architecture

### Decision: Component-Based Architecture with Custom Hooks
React application using container/presentational pattern with specialized hooks for mobile interactions.

### Rationale
- **Mobile-First Design**: TailwindCSS breakpoint system enables progressive enhancement
- **Touch Optimization**: @use-gesture/react for swipe navigation and touch interactions
- **Performance**: Code splitting by routes and features, <500KB initial bundle target
- **Component Reusability**: Compound components for complex features like setlist management
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strong typing for band management domain models

### Key Patterns
- **Responsive Grid Layouts**: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` progression
- **Touch Target Sizing**: Minimum 44px (iOS), optimal 48px (Material), comfortable 56px
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Mobile-first utilities with larger screen adaptations
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe navigation between songs, long press for quick actions

## Development Stack Decisions

### Core Technologies
- **React 18+**: Latest stable with concurrent features for mobile performance
- **TypeScript 5.x**: Strong typing for complex band management data models
- **TailwindCSS**: Mobile-first utility framework with custom musician-specific utilities
- **Dexie.js**: Client-side database with React integration
- **Vitest + React Testing Library**: Testing stack optimized for modern React

### Build and Deployment
- **Vite**: Fast development server and optimized production builds
- **Vercel**: Static deployment platform with automatic optimizations
- **Service Workers**: Offline capability for practice sessions
- **Bundle Optimization**: Lazy loading for heavy features (chord viewers, audio tools)

## Mobile Performance Optimizations

### Bundle Strategy
- **Route-Based Splitting**: Separate bundles for Songs, Practice, Setlists, and Band management
- **Component Lazy Loading**: Heavy features loaded on demand (chord diagrams, audio recorder)
- **Asset Optimization**: WebP images with fallbacks, progressive audio loading

### Touch and Gesture Optimization
- **Swipe Navigation**: Between songs in setlists and practice sessions
- **Long Press Actions**: Quick access to song options and practice controls
- **Drag & Drop**: Setlist reordering with haptic feedback
- **Double Tap**: Tempo adjustments and quick practice mode toggles

### Data Architecture
```typescript
interface Song {
  id: string
  title: string
  artist: string
  key: string
  tempo: number
  duration: number
  difficulty: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
  practiceHistory: PracticeSession[]
}

interface PracticeSession {
  id: string
  songId: string
  startTime: Date
  endTime?: Date
  notes?: string
  completedSections: string[]
}

interface Setlist {
  id: string
  name: string
  songs: Song[]
  event?: string
  date?: Date
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Multi-Device Testing
- **Mobile Viewports**: iPhone SE (375px), standard mobile (414px)
- **Tablet Viewports**: iPad Mini (768px), iPad Pro (1024px)
- **Desktop Viewports**: Standard (1920px) for studio use

### Performance Testing
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial load for mobile networks
- **Load Time**: <3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Offline Functionality**: All core features work without network

### User Experience Testing
- **Practice Session Flows**: Complete workflow testing from song selection to session completion
- **Touch Interactions**: Gesture recognition and haptic feedback verification
- **Responsive Behavior**: Layout adaptation across all target devices
