# Implementation Plan: Rock On! - Band Management Platform

**Branch**: `001-use-this-prd` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/workspaces/rock-on/specs/001-use-this-prd/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
"Rock On!" is a band management platform enabling musicians to coordinate rehearsals, manage song repertoires, and prepare for performances. The MVP focuses on song catalog management, practice session planning, setlist creation, and readiness tracking. Technical approach uses React with TypeScript for mobile-first responsive design, TailwindCSS for consistent styling, and a client-side database for offline capability.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with React 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: React, TailwindCSS, client-side database (TBD)
**Storage**: Client-side lightweight database engine (no third-party services)
**Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (mobile-first responsive)
**Project Type**: single - React SPA with mobile-first design
**Performance Goals**: <200ms page load, 60fps interactions, mobile optimized
**Constraints**: No external database services, Vercel deployment compatible, offline-capable
**Scale/Scope**: MVP demonstration capabilities, 3-8 band members, basic feature set

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Code Quality First**: ✅ PASS - TypeScript enforces type safety, TailwindCSS provides consistent styling
**II. User Experience Consistency**: ✅ PASS - Mobile-first design with TailwindCSS ensures consistent patterns
**III. Rapid Prototyping with MVP Focus**: ✅ PASS - Basic demonstration capabilities focus, proven React/Tailwind stack
**IV. Test-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS - Vitest + RTL planned for comprehensive testing
**V. Ease of Implementation**: ✅ PASS - Client-side only, simple Vercel deployment, no external services

**Structure Decision**: Single React application with mobile-first responsive design. Component-based architecture with feature-organized folders (songs, sessions, setlists, bands). Client-side data persistence using lightweight database. TailwindCSS for styling with mobile-first breakpoints.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
- Generate setup tasks: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Dexie.js project initialization
- Create contract test tasks from API contracts (songs, sessions, setlists) - each contract file generates one test task [P]
- Generate data model tasks from entities (Band, Member, Song, PracticeSession, Setlist) - each entity creates one model task [P]
- Create component tasks for mobile-first UI (song catalog, practice timer, setlist builder)
- Generate integration test tasks from quickstart scenarios (5 main workflows)
- Implementation tasks follow TDD order: database setup → models → services → components → pages

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Project setup and dependencies (Vite, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Dexie.js)
- Phase 2: Database schema and models (parallel execution for different entities)
- Phase 3: Contract tests (parallel execution for different API endpoints)
- Phase 4: Service layer implementation (sequential, depends on models)
- Phase 5: UI components (parallel execution for different features)
- Phase 6: Integration tests and mobile optimization

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks focusing on mobile-first MVP capabilities

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
