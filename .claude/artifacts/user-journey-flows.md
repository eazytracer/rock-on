# Rock On! User Journey Flows
## Personal Space + Band Management User Experience Design

### Core Concept: Personal Music Library + Band Collaboration

**Key Innovation:** Every user starts with a **personal music workspace** that exists independently of bands, allowing them to:
- Build their own song library and practice tracking
- Experiment with the app before committing to band collaboration
- Maintain personal progress even when switching between multiple bands
- Contribute their existing library when joining or creating bands

## Technical Implementation: Data Architecture

### 🗄️ **Database Schema Evolution**
```typescript
// User-centric design
User {
  id, email, name, instruments[]
  personalSettings: {...}
  createdDate, lastActive
}

// Personal workspace
PersonalLibrary {
  userId, songId
  personalConfidence: 1-5
  personalNotes: string
  lastPersonalPractice: Date
}

// Band membership
BandMembership {
  userId, bandId
  role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member'
  instruments: string[]  // what they play in THIS band
  joinDate, status
}

// Band-specific song data
BandSong {
  bandId, songId
  addedBy: userId
  source: 'band_original' | 'personal_import' | 'external'
  assignments: { userId: instrument[] }[]
}

// Practice tracking (separate personal vs band)
PracticeSession {
  id, userId?, bandId?  // personal if userId only, band if bandId
  type: 'personal' | 'band'
  songs: [...], duration, notes
}
```

### 🔀 **Data Flow Examples**
**Personal Song → Band Recommendation:**
1. User clicks "Recommend to Band" on personal song
2. Creates `BandSongSuggestion` record
3. Band admins see notification
4. On approval, creates `BandSong` with `source: 'personal_import'`

**Band Practice → Personal Tracking:**
1. Band practice session includes individual participation
2. Each member gets personal practice credit
3. Updates both band readiness AND personal confidence
4. Maintains separation for privacy/motivation
