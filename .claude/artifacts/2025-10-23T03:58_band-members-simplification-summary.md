# Band Members Instrument Simplification

## Overview
Simplified the instrument management interface in BandMembersPage.tsx to use multi-select buttons without proficiency levels, making the UI cleaner and more user-friendly.

## Major Changes

### 1. Data Structure Simplification
**File:** `/workspaces/rock-on/src/pages/NewLayout/BandMembersPage.tsx`

- **Removed proficiency field** from `Instrument` interface
- **Before:**
  ```typescript
  interface Instrument {
    name: string
    proficiency: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced' | 'expert'
    isPrimary?: boolean
  }
  ```
- **After:**
  ```typescript
  interface Instrument {
    name: string
    isPrimary?: boolean
  }
  ```

### 2. Updated Mock Data
- Removed all `proficiency` fields from mock member instruments
- Added more diverse instrument combinations to showcase multi-select
- Example:
  - Eric Thompson: Guitar (primary), Vocals, Bass
  - Mike Johnson: Bass (primary), Harmonica, Vocals, Guitar

### 3. New Multi-Select UI

#### Instrument Selection Grid
- 3-4 column grid of preset instrument buttons
- Click to toggle selection (orange = selected, gray = unselected)
- "+ Custom" button for adding custom instruments
- Can select as many instruments as needed

#### Selected Instruments List
- Shows all selected instruments with star buttons
- Click star to mark/unmark as primary
- Only one instrument can be primary at a time
- Remove button (X) on each selected instrument
- Visual feedback: Primary instruments show "Primary" badge

### 4. Simplified Handler Functions

**Removed:**
- `handleAddInstrument()` - one-at-a-time approach
- `handleUpdateInstrument()` - complex updates
- `handleSelectCustomInstrument()` - index-based custom input
- `getProficiencyBadge()` - proficiency styling

**Added:**
- `handleToggleInstrument(instrumentName)` - toggle selection on/off
- `handleTogglePrimary(instrumentName)` - set primary instrument
- `handleAddCustomInstrument()` - add custom instrument directly to list
- `handleCancelCustomInstrument()` - cancel custom input

### 5. UI Improvements

#### Edit Instruments Modal
- **Wider modal** (max-w-2xl instead of max-w-md) to accommodate button grid
- **Three sections:**
  1. Available Instruments (button grid for selection)
  2. Custom Instrument Input (appears when "+ Custom" clicked)
  3. Selected Instruments List (with star/remove controls)

#### Member Detail Modal
- Removed proficiency badges
- Simplified instrument display to just show names with star for primary

### 6. Removed Components
- Proficiency selection buttons (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert)
- Per-instrument custom input fields
- "Add Instrument" button (replaced with multi-select grid)
- Complex instrument card layout

## Key Features

### Multi-Select Workflow
1. **Select Instruments:** Click any number of instrument buttons in the grid
2. **Add Custom:** Click "+ Custom" to add non-preset instruments
3. **Set Primary:** Click star icon on any selected instrument to make it primary
4. **Remove:** Click X button to remove an instrument from selection

### Visual Feedback
- **Selected instruments:** Orange background (#f17827)
- **Unselected instruments:** Gray background (#2a2a2a)
- **Primary instrument:** Star icon in orange with "Primary" badge
- **Non-primary instruments:** Gray star that turns orange on hover

## Technical Improvements

### State Management
- Changed `showCustomInstrumentInput` from `number | null` to `boolean`
- Simplified custom instrument handling
- Removed index-based instrument updates

### Code Cleanup
- Removed unused `Plus` icon import
- Removed `proficiencyOptions` constant
- Removed "Other" from `instrumentPresets` (replaced by custom input)

## Benefits

1. **Simpler UX:** No need to understand proficiency levels
2. **Faster Input:** Select multiple instruments at once instead of one-by-one
3. **Clearer Hierarchy:** Primary instrument clearly marked with star
4. **Cleaner Code:** Fewer handlers, simpler state management
5. **Better Visual Feedback:** Immediate feedback on selection state

## Files Modified
- `/workspaces/rock-on/src/pages/NewLayout/BandMembersPage.tsx`

## Build Status
- TypeScript compilation successful (no errors in BandMembersPage)
- All features working as expected
