# Phase 3: Context-Specific Casting System - Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of **Phase 3 Backend Services** for the Rock On multi-user band management application. Phase 3 introduces a comprehensive context-specific casting system that allows band leaders to assign different roles to members for different songs and performance contexts (acoustic vs electric, setlists vs practice sessions).

## What Was Completed

### ✅ Phase 3.1: Casting Database Schema & Models (All tasks completed)

**Files Created:**
- `src/models/SongCasting.ts` - Complete casting models with comprehensive TypeScript types
- Database schema updated to **v4** with new casting tables

**Database Schema v4 Changes:**
```typescript
// New tables for casting system
songCastings: '++id, contextType, contextId, songId, createdBy, createdDate'
songAssignments: '++id, songCastingId, memberId, isPrimary, confidence, addedBy, addedDate'
assignmentRoles: '++id, assignmentId, type, name, isPrimary'
castingTemplates: '++id, bandId, name, contextType, createdBy, createdDate'
memberCapabilities: '++id, userId, bandId, roleType, proficiencyLevel, isPrimary, updatedDate'
```

**Models Created:**
- **SongCasting**: Represents casting configuration for a song in a specific context
- **SongAssignment**: Individual role assignment within a casting (one per member)
- **AssignmentRole**: Multi-role support (member can have guitar + vocals for same song)
- **CastingTemplate**: Reusable casting configurations for different contexts
- **MemberCapability**: Tracks member skills and proficiency levels
- **CastingSuggestion**: AI-generated role assignment suggestions
- **CastingStats**: Analytics for member assignments

**Role Types Supported:**
- Vocals: Lead, Backing, Harmony
- Guitar: Lead, Rhythm, Acoustic
- Bass
- Drums
- Percussion
- Keys: Piano, Synth, Organ
- Other

### ✅ Phase 3.2: Core Services (T303, T309, T310)

## Key User Workflows (Backend Ready)

### 1. Create Casting for Setlist Song
```typescript
// Create casting
const castingId = await SetlistService.createSongCasting(
  setlistId,
  songId,
  currentUserId
)

// Assign member with multiple roles
await castingService.assignMember(
  castingId,
  memberId,
  [
    { type: 'guitar_lead', name: 'Lead Guitar', isPrimary: true },
    { type: 'vocals_backing', name: 'Backing Vocals', isPrimary: false }
  ],
  true, // isPrimary member
  4,    // confidence (1-5)
  'Drop D tuning for lead parts',
  currentUserId
)
```

### 2. Get Smart Casting Suggestions
```typescript
// Get suggestions for a song
const suggestions = await castingSuggestionService.getSuggestionsForSong(
  songId,
  bandId,
  'acoustic' // context type
)

// suggestions = [
//   { memberId: 'alice', roleType: 'guitar_acoustic', confidence: 0.9, reason: 'Primary role - Expert level' },
//   { memberId: 'bob', roleType: 'bass', confidence: 0.8, reason: 'Advanced - 5+ years experience' },
//   ...
// ]
```

### 3. Copy Casting from Setlist to Session
```typescript
// Inherit casting when creating practice session from setlist
await PracticeSessionService.inheritCastingFromSetlist(
  sessionId,
  setlistId,
  currentUserId
)
```

### 4. Track Member Capabilities
```typescript
// Set member's capability
await memberCapabilityService.setCapability({
  userId: 'alice',
  bandId: 'band1',
  roleType: 'guitar_lead',
  proficiencyLevel: 5, // Expert
  isPrimary: true,
  yearsExperience: 10,
  notes: 'Specializes in rock and metal'
})

// Auto-detect from assignment history
await memberCapabilityService.detectCapabilitiesFromHistory(
  userId,
  bandId
)
```

## Technical Decisions

### Multi-Role Support
**Decision**: Use separate `AssignmentRole` table instead of array in `SongAssignment`
**Rationale**:
- Enables efficient querying of specific roles
- Allows complex role relationships (primary/secondary)
- Supports role-specific arrangement notes

### Context-Based Casting
**Decision**: Use `contextType` + `contextId` instead of direct foreign keys
**Rationale**:
- Single casting system works for setlists, sessions, and templates
- Easy to copy casting between contexts
- Flexible for future context types

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm
**Factors:**
1. **Proficiency Level** (50% weight): Member's skill rating (1-5)
2. **Historical Performance** (30% weight): Past assignment confidence averages
3. **Primary Role Bonus** (20% weight): Extra points for member's primary role

**Example Calculation:**
```
Alice - Lead Guitar for "Wonderwall"
- Proficiency: 5/5 → 0.5 points (50%)
- History: avg 4.5/5 in past lead guitar → 0.27 points (30%)
- Primary role: Yes → 0.2 points (20%)
= Total: 0.97 confidence (97%)
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### UI Components (Not Yet Implemented) ⏳

The following UI components from the original Phase 3 plan are **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**:

**Pending Components:**
- [ ] T305: SetlistCastingView - Assign roles for entire setlist
- [ ] T306: SongCastingEditor - Detailed role assignment per song
- [ ] T307: MemberRoleSelector - Multi-role assignment interface
- [ ] T308: CastingComparison - Compare casting across contexts

**Pending Integration:**
- [ ] T313: Update Setlists page with casting management UI
- [ ] T314: Update practice session flow with assigned roles display
- [ ] T315: Test casting flow with multiple contexts

### Technical Debt
- **Casting UI**: Complete backend ready, but no UI components yet
- **Template System**: `CastingTemplate` model exists but not fully utilized
- **Workload Balancing**: Basic implementation, could be more sophisticated
- **Conflict Detection**: Only detects drums + instrument conflicts, could expand

### Performance Considerations
- **Suggestion Algorithm**: Limited to first 10 songs for performance (O(10n))
- **History Detection**: Can be expensive with many assignments (consider caching)
- **Nested Queries**: Some methods use nested async loops (could batch)

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend API Testing (Can Test Now)
```typescript
// Test 1: Create casting and assign roles
const castingId = await castingService.createCasting({
  contextType: 'setlist',
  contextId: setlistId,
  songId: songId,
  createdBy: 'alice@example.com'
})

const assignmentId = await castingService.assignMember(
  castingId,
  'bob@example.com',
  [
    { type: 'bass', name: 'Bass', isPrimary: true }
  ],
  true,
  4
)

// Test 2: Get complete casting
const completeCasting = await castingService.getCompleteCasting(castingId)
console.log(completeCasting) // Should include assignments and roles

// Test 3: Copy casting
await castingService.copyCasting('setlist', setlistId, 'session', sessionId, 'alice@example.com')

// Test 4: Get suggestions
const suggestions = await castingSuggestionService.getSuggestionsForSong(
  songId,
  'band1',
  'electric'
)
console.log(suggestions) // Should return ranked suggestions
```

### Manual Testing (Needs UI)
- Cannot test UI workflows until components are built
- Backend services can be tested via browser console
- Database can be inspected via IndexedDB DevTools

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Core Casting UI (Essential)
To make Phase 3 usable, we need at minimum:
1. **Simple Casting Editor**: Add role assignments to songs in setlists
2. **Member Role Selector**: Choose members and roles with dropdowns
3. **Casting Display**: Show assigned roles in setlist and session views

### Priority 2: Enhanced Features (Nice to Have)
1. **Casting Suggestions UI**: Display AI suggestions with confidence levels
2. **Casting Comparison**: Compare different casting configurations
3. **Template Management**: Create and apply casting templates
4. **Workload View**: Visual display of assignment distribution

### Priority 3: Testing & Polish
1. Create end-to-end tests for casting workflows
2. Add error handling and validation in UI
3. Optimize suggestion algorithm performance
4. Add casting analytics and reporting

## Code Quality Notes

### Strengths
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types throughout
- **Service Separation**: Clean separation between casting, capabilities, and suggestions
- **Database Design**: Flexible schema supports multiple contexts
- **Multi-role Support**: Members can have multiple roles per song
- **Smart Suggestions**: Multi-factor confidence scoring algorithm
- **Reusability**: Casting can be copied between contexts
- **Auto-timestamps**: Database hooks ensure data consistency

### Code Statistics
- **New Models**: 9 interfaces (SongCasting, SongAssignment, AssignmentRole, etc.)
- **New Services**: 3 major services (CastingService, MemberCapabilityService, CastingSuggestionService)
- **New Database Tables**: 5 tables (songCastings, songAssignments, assignmentRoles, castingTemplates, memberCapabilities)
- **Total Lines**: ~900+ lines of backend code
- **Build Time**: 1.23s (excellent performance)
