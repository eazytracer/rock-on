## Technical Notes

### State Management
- All state is local component state (no global state)
- Parent `AuthPages` component manages view routing
- Child components receive callbacks for navigation
- User data updates propagate through callbacks

### No Database Integration
- All data is in-memory (resets on page refresh)
- Login validates against hardcoded mock user
- Band operations simulate database with mock arrays
- No persistence between sessions

### Performance
- All transitions use CSS (no heavy animations)
- Timeouts simulate network latency (1-2 seconds)
- Components are lightweight (single file)
- No unnecessary re-renders

### Code Organization
- Reusable UI components (InputField, Button, Toast)
- Separate components for each page/modal
- Clear prop interfaces
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comments for major sections

## Future Enhancements

When integrating with real authentication:
1. Replace mock user with actual auth service
2. Add real password hashing/validation
3. Integrate with band database
4. Add email verification flow
5. Implement forgot password
6. Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
7. Add profile photo upload
8. Add 2FA support
9. Add session management
10. Add audit log for account changes

## Compliance

This implementation follows all requirements from:
- ✅ `/workspaces/rock-on/.claude/instructions/mvp-auth-pages.md`
- ✅ Design color scheme (Orange primary, NOT blue)
- ✅ All 15 user stories implemented
- ✅ Mock data only (no database)
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Success feedback
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Accessibility considerations

## Summary

The Authentication Pages component is a fully functional, self-contained demonstration of all authentication and account management flows specified in the MVP requirements. It uses mock data exclusively, making it perfect for UI/UX testing and design validation without requiring any backend infrastructure.

All features are working and can be tested interactively at `/auth-demo`.
