### Sprint 4: Routing & Context (Tasks 14-18)

#### Task 14: Routing Updates ✅
- **File:** `/workspaces/rock-on/src/App.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - New pages are now primary routes:
    - `/auth` → AuthPages
    - `/songs` → SongsPage (protected)
    - `/setlists` → SetlistsPage (protected)
    - `/shows` → ShowsPage (protected)
    - `/practices` → PracticesPage (protected)
    - `/band-members` → BandMembersPage (protected)

  - BandMembersPage enforces:
    - Only owner/admin can edit members
    - Only owner can transfer ownership
    - Members can only view
  - Other pages currently allow all authenticated users to perform CRUD
  - Permission checks can be added using: `const { currentUserRole } = useAuth()`

#### Task 17: Error Handling & Loading States ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - All hooks return `{ loading, error }` states
  - All pages display loading spinners while fetching data
  - All pages display error messages on failure
  - All database operations wrapped in try-catch blocks
  - User-friendly error messages via toasts/alerts
  - Console logging for debugging

#### Task 18: Data Consistency & Relationships ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - `useDeleteSong()`: Removes song from all setlists before deletion
  - `useDeleteSetlist()`: Clears show.setlistId references before deletion
  - `useDeleteShow()`: Clears setlist.showId references before deletion
  - `useRemoveBandMember()`: Deletes membership (keeps created data)
  - Bi-directional references maintained (show↔setlist)
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Phase 2 is COMPLETE!** The MVP is now fully integrated with IndexedDB database using the Version 5 schema. All pages have been successfully migrated from mock data to real database operations, and the application is ready for comprehensive user testing.

The new database-connected pages are now the primary routes of the application, with all previous routes preserved under `/old/*` for backward compatibility. The authentication flow, band management, song library, setlist builder, show scheduler, and practice planner are all fully functional with persistent data storage.

**Next Milestone**: Sprint 5 - End-to-End Testing & Validation

**Status**: Ready for user acceptance testing
**Date Completed**: 2025-10-23
