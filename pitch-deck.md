# Rock On! - Hackathon Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1: The Problem
- Bands struggle coordinating practice sessions
- Song readiness tracking is chaotic
- Setlist planning causes last-minute stress
- Communication scattered across multiple platforms
- Performance preparation lacks structure

**Speaker Notes:** Every band faces the same coordination nightmare - scattered communication, forgotten practice schedules, and last-minute scrambling to figure out which songs are actually ready for performance.

---

## Slide 2: Target Users
- Small bands (3-8 members)
- Amateur to semi-professional musicians
- Cover bands and originals
- Music educators with ensembles
- Growing market: 1.2M active bands

**Speaker Notes:** We're targeting the massive market of small bands who need better organization but can't afford expensive professional tools.

---

## Slide 3: Current Solutions Fall Short
- Google Sheets: clunky, no automation
- BandHelper: outdated, complex interface
- Text groups: information gets lost
- Paper setlists: inflexible, error-prone
- No integrated practice tracking

**Speaker Notes:** Musicians currently cobble together solutions using spreadsheets and text messages, leading to miscommunication and inefficient practice time.

---
