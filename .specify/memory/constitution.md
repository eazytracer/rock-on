# Rock-On Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
Code MUST be clean, readable, and maintainable from the first implementation. No "quick and dirty" solutions that require later refactoring. All code MUST pass linting, type checking, and formatting standards before merge. Technical debt is only acceptable when explicitly documented with a remediation plan and timeline.

**Rationale**: Quality code reduces debugging time, onboarding friction, and maintenance costs, enabling faster long-term development velocity.

### II. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing interfaces MUST follow established design patterns and interaction models within the project. Components MUST be reusable and composable. API responses MUST follow consistent schemas and error handling patterns. Documentation and CLI interfaces MUST use consistent terminology and command structures.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load for users and developers, enabling faster adoption and fewer support requests.

### III. Rapid Prototyping with MVP Focus
Features MUST be implemented as Minimum Viable Products (MVP) first. Complex features MUST be broken into incremental deliverables where each increment provides user value. Prioritize working software over comprehensive documentation. Use proven libraries and patterns over custom implementations.

**Rationale**: MVP approach enables faster user feedback, reduces development risk, and allows for course correction based on real usage.

### IV. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation. All tests MUST fail initially, then pass after implementation (Red-Green-Refactor). Contract tests are required for all external interfaces. Integration tests are required for user workflows. Code coverage MUST exceed 80% for business logic.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures code correctness, enables confident refactoring, and serves as living documentation of system behavior.

### V. Ease of Implementation
Choose simple, well-documented solutions over complex ones. Prefer configuration over code when possible. Use standard project structures and naming conventions. Dependencies MUST be lightweight and well-maintained. Setup and deployment MUST be automated and documented.

**Rationale**: Simple implementations reduce cognitive overhead, enable faster onboarding, and minimize maintenance burden.

## Development Standards

All implementations MUST follow language-specific best practices and established community conventions. Error handling MUST be explicit and user-friendly. Logging MUST be structured and include sufficient context for debugging. Performance MUST be measured and documented for critical paths.

Security considerations MUST be addressed in design phase. Secrets and credentials MUST never be committed to repositories. Input validation MUST be implemented at system boundaries.

## Implementation Workflow

Feature development follows a strict TDD workflow: Specification → Plan → Tests → Implementation → Validation. All features MUST have clear acceptance criteria before development begins. Code reviews are mandatory and MUST verify constitutional compliance.

Deployments MUST be automated and include rollback procedures. Breaking changes MUST be communicated with migration guides. Version bumps MUST follow semantic versioning principles.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and conventions. All pull requests MUST verify compliance with these principles before merge. Deviations require explicit justification and approval from project maintainers.

Amendments to this constitution require documentation of rationale, impact analysis, and migration plan for existing code. All amendments MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing tooling and processes.

Constitutional violations MUST be addressed immediately - code that violates principles cannot be merged regardless of functionality.
